# Teaching-Apps-MacOSX

Interactive Teaching Applications, designed to illustate the underlying mathematics of a number of common Electrophysiological techniques. The apps are targeted to benefit students in a number of disiplines including Physiology, Human Health and Disease, Neuroscience and BioEngineering. The apps provide an interactive way of processing and analysing electrophysiological signals and also give insight into some  impairments associated with a number of common neurological disorders. 

The interactive teaching apps were developed by Michael Broderick and Bahman Nasseroleslami on behalf of the Dean's Awards for Teaching and Innovation. The development is a result of collaborative efforts internal and external to Trinity College Dublin. Collaborators include Dr. Edmund Lalor, Dr. Richard Reilly, Dr. Alice Witney and Dr. Richard Carson of Trinity College. Developers also received data from Greg Pearcey and Dr. Paul Zehr, University of Victoria, Canada. There are 4 apps in total. 3 are currently available and 1 remains under development.

EEG: In this app, a user learns about a number of common techniques involved in Electroencephalography, including baseline referencing, common average referencing, filtering and averaging epochs. The user is able to analyse the signals produced in different electrodes placed over the scalp and must use the processing tecniques to produce clear and meaningful signal. 

EMG: This apps teaches users about the effects of the H-reflex and M-Wave on Electromyographic recordings. Users are able to manually adjust the stimulus intensity and view the effect these changes have on the soleus muscle at rest and in contraction. The app displays animations of the paths the physiological impulses take from a full view and individual motor pathway level. 

TMS: This features common measurements and measuring techniques associated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Users can observe the motor pathways of electrical impulses originating from external stimuli and differences in responses of patients suffering from a number of common neurological impairments when compared with healthy controls
